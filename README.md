<h1>Brief Tutorial on Github</h1>

**1) Create your Account**

  Create your Github account by filling out the required credentials such as your username and email.
  
  **2) Verify your Account**
  
  Once you've entered in all the credentials, Github will ask you to enter your verification code, which will have been sent to the email that you used for your Github account. Once that code has been entered, your account will be verified.
  
  **3) Creating a New Repository**
  
  When creating a new repository to store projects, code, etc., there are a few things that must be done first, such as naming the repository (apparently Github doesn't like it when the name of the repository starts with a lowercase letter), and making it either public (everyone can view it) or private (only you can view it).
